## DevOps Journey ðŸš€  

This repository documents my hands-on learning in DevOps. It contains practical exercises on various tools and technologies, including:  

<!-- - **Cloud Provider / Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): AWS (Amazon Web Services)**   -->
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform**
    - **[Terraform using AWS](terraform/terraform_with_aws/)**
    <!-- - **[Terraform using VSphere](terraform/terraform_with_vsphere/)** -->
<!-- - **Ansible** -->
- **More to come!**  

Each folder contains a separate **README.md** with details on the exercises.
